# mini-proj-3

* Be able to apply PCA to reduce the high dimensional feature space to facilitate ML for high dimensional data.
* Like Minproject Deliverable #2, focus on the clustering of non-extreme multi-port scanners based on the 120 top ports they scanned.
* Be able to reduce the high dimensionality of One-Hot-Encoded features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Be able to perform k-means with and without dimension reduction using PCA, and compare the results using silhouette score and mirai external labels.
* Be able to obtain cluster centers of the original feature space for clustering results using PCA and k-means.
* After successful clustering of the small Darknet dataset (with and without dimension reduction using PCA), conduct clustering on the large Darknet dataset in the cluster mode.
* Compare the clustering results of the large dataset with and without dimension reduction using PCA.
